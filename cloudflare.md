Our automated scan checks for vulnerabilities in every nook and cranny of your website. Using the same techniques as malicious hackers, we systematically test all the access points, giving you step-by-step instructions on how to eliminate any threat.

### What Does It Find?

Our scan first checks your website for the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks. We then check your site for other known security holes. Since our scanner is constantly being updated, you can rest assured that you are protected against the latest threats. We regularly incorporate new tests and consistently score higher than any other scanner on open-source benchmarks.
